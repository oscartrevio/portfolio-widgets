Family is a self-custody crypto wallet for iOS that I’ve been working on for the past ~2 years.

It has been (very graciously, I might add!) praised for its unique feel and sensibilities. I've stumbled upon multiple recreations of Family's individual components for both mobile and even the web, many executed with exceptional skill.

Seeing this prompted me to sit down and try to share the essence behind Family, which is as much about connection and experience as it is about technology and design.

This is not a technical post or tutorial. There are many good resources about how to craft smooth animations or design pixel perfect UI, by people much smarter than I am.1

This is about how we made something complex feel welcoming. It’s about what makes Family feel familiar.

# What makes Family, Family

The journey of developing Family led us to naturally form a set of guiding principles. These values emerged over time as we tackled the challenges of designing a new kind of crypto wallet. Throughout our team discussions and early iterations, we established three core principles: simplicity, fluidity, and delight.

Simplicity ensures accessibility, fluidity maintains continuity of experience, and delight fosters meaningful connections.

> This guide is an abstraction from Github's Formatting Syntax documentation.[^1]

This approach is how we respect the user's time, intelligence, and experience. It's how we create an environment within Family where every interaction feels considered and worthwhile.

## Simplicity 

Simplicity is about making the complex feel familiar. It's about reducing friction and cognitive load. It's about creating an environment where the user feels in control. 




# Headings

To create a heading, add one to two <kbd>#</kbd> symbols before your heading text. The number of <kbd>#</kbd> you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

<Preview codeblock>
  <div>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <div/>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  </div>
</Preview>

```text copy
# Heading 1
# Heading 2
```

# Styling Text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

<Preview codeblock>
  <div>**Bold**</div>
  <div>*Italic*</div>
  <div>~~Strikethrough~~</div>
  <div><sub>Subscript</sub></div>
  <div><sup>Superscript</sup></div>
  <div><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd></div>
</Preview>

```text
**Bold**
*Italic*
~~Strikethrough~~
<sub>Subscript</sub>
<sup>Superscript</sup>
<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>
```

# Quoting Text

You can quote text with a <kbd>></kbd>.

<Preview codeblock>
  Text that is not a quote
  > Text that is a quote
</Preview>
```text
Text that is not a quote
> Text that is a quote
```

# Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses.

<Preview codeblock>
  [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
</Preview>
```text
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
```

# Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with <kbd>-</kbd>.

<Preview codeblock>
  - George Washington
  - John Adams
  - Thomas Jefferson
</Preview>
```text
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
```
To order your list, precede each line with a number.

<Preview codeblock>
  1. James Madison
  2. James Monroe
  3. John Quincy Adams
</Preview>
```text
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
```

# Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax <kbd>`[^1]`</kbd> and then defining the footnote at the bottom of your content.


<Preview codeblock>
  <div>The invention of the printing press revolutionized the spread of information in Europe during the 15th century.[^2]</div>

  [^2]: Johannes Gutenberg is credited with inventing the movable-type printing press around 1440 in Mainz, Germany.
</Preview>
```text

[^2]: Johannes Gutenberg is credited with inventing the movable-type printing press around 1440 in Mainz, Germany.
```

# Preview 

You can preview your markdown content in real-time by using the preview feature in the editor. We have been using it throughout this guide to show you how your markdown content will look when rendered. It comes with a single prop, <kbd>codeblock</kbd>, that you can use to display the code block right below the preview.

<Preview codeblock>
  <Preview codeblock>
   <div className="bg-gray-2 border-gray-4 border w-32 h-16 rounded"/>
  </Preview>
  ```tsx
    <div className="bg-red-400 w-32 h-16 rounded"/>
  ```
</Preview>
```tsx
<Preview>
  <div className="bg-gray-2 border-gray-4 border w-32 h-16 rounded"/>
</Preview>
```

# Inline Code

Append <kbd>`{:lang}{:js}`</kbd> (e.g. <kbd>`{:js}{:js}`</kbd>) to the end of inline code to highlight it like a regular code block.

<Preview codeblock>
  To useEffect or not to `useEffect(){:tsx}`, that is the question.
</Preview>
```text
This is an array `[1, 2, 3]{:js}` of numbers 1 through 3.
```


# Code Blocks

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
 
<Preview codeblock>
```tsx
function feature() {
  return "It works in my environment.";
}
```
</Preview>
```text
```tsx  
function feature() {
  return "It works in my environment.";
}
```‎
```

# Media

You can embed images, videos, and other media in your markdown content. You can also add captions to your images via the <kbd>`<Image/>`</kbd> component.

## Images

<Preview codeblock>
<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Image src='https://i.pinimg.com/enabled/564x/2c/3c/53/2c3c532683e4e66fc216e07d31c95a2d.jpg' alt='Placeholder' caption='Avatar'/>
</div>
</Preview>
```text
<Image src='https://avatar.vercel.sh/sylph' alt='Placeholder' caption='Avatar'/>
```

# Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens <kbd>-</kbd> (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe <kbd>|</kbd>.

<Preview codeblock>
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
</Preview>
```text
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```
